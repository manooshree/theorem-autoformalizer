# theorem-autoformalizer
**Experiments on auto-formalizing natural language theorem statements into Lean4. **

I used 2 open source NL-FL datasets, filtering by linear algebra to determine performance for linear algebra theorems: 
[ProofNet](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5/blob/main/datasets/proofnet.jsonl)
[FormL4](https://github.com/rookie-joe/PDA/blob/main/data/FormL4/basic_test.json)

I include both qualitative and quantitative results of my experiments. My fine-tuning and eval code and proofnet dataset can be found in the repo. Model checkpoints were not released due to size limitations.
